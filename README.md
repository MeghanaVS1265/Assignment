# Assignment
Assignment_DS
There are two program files:
1. Assignment.ipynb: This file contains the main implementation.
2. Assignment.pdf: Pdf version of the above file.
The file path of the dataset was not hardcoded but was instead read directly from my drive given the large size.


Steps to execute the program:
Note: These files can be executed in Google Colab or through Jupyter Notebook.
1. If using Google Colab, the csv file can be directly uploaded in run-time or this file should be stored in your drive and a path should be provided in the Eluvio_DS.ipynb file to read the file.
2. Run all the cells

I recommend using Google Colab given the size of the dataset as it is easy to use and read. This file executes on my end. Please let me know if you face any issue when running the file.


Thank you!
